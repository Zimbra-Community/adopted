Adopted Zimlets and developments
================================

Introduction
------------

This repository holds zimlets, that were adopted by developers by seemingly or actual orphaned zimlets.

If you have other zimlets, that you've updated but can't reach the author so he/she could update the gallery, please
send a pull request to have them included here.

The zimlets available here mostly are more compatible with current Zimbra versions and have bugs fixed and 
new features added.
